      A Look Into Taylor Swift's Albums
  </h2>

  <div>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      Since 2006, Taylor Alison Swift has released 12 studio albums, 4 rerecorded albums, 32 compilations, 5 extended plays (EPs), and 4 live albums. She is noted and applauded for successfully traversing multiple genres within her discography. She started out as a country/country-pop artist with her first four albums. By <i> 1989 </i>, she switched to a pure pop sound. Come 2020 with her album <i> folklore </i>, she took on an indie, alternative sound. She returned to pop with <i> Midnights </i>, albeit with a much mellow, softer sound.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      Her first debut album, <i> Taylor Swift </i>, released in 2006, introduced her as the "sweet girl-next-door" that everyone could relate to. It tackled topics regarding crushes, heartbreak, and a sense of wanting to find yourself and your place in this world. Even though she was young, Swift had shown her exceptional song-writing skills. Songs such as "Cold as You" (which started the tradition known as the "Track 5"s, which are often emotional), "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)", and "Tied Together with a Smile" were praised by fans and critics for heart-wrenching, imaginative storytelling. "Our Song" and "Teardrops on My Guitar" were smash hits. Critics regarded the album as one of those that made country more accessible and widespread.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      Her next album, <i> Fearless </i>, gave us the hits "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", the latter winning a VMA for Video of the Year, leading to the historic Kanye West interruption. Fearless also won Swift her first Grammy for Album of the Year (AOTY). <i> Speak Now </i> adopted a more fairy-tale aesthetic, was entirely self-written by Swift, contained more rock elements ("Better than Revenge", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly"). <i> Red </i> became a turning point in her career, as she showed herself branching out and experimenting with new genres, mainly pop. <i> Red </i> spawned Swift's first #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, that being the lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      After losing to Daft Punk's <i> Random Access Memories </i> for Album of the Year with <i> Red </i>, Swift decided to go out of her comfort zone. She released <i> 1989 </i>, which marked her complete transition into pop. It received critical acclaim from critics and fans, and spawned classics from Swift's discography, such as the ever-popular "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Style", "Bad Blood", and "Wildest Dreams" (the former of the two being her most YouTube music videos). <i> 1989 </i> also scored Taylor's second AOTY.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      Swift received a lot of hate and backlash after supposedly "starring" in Kanye West's music video for "Famous" and an edited phone call between her and West was leaked by Kim Kardashian. After disappearing for a year, she came back and released <i> reputation </i> in 2017. The album sported a dark aesthetic, being more defiant and bold than her previous albums, and touched on the themes of revenge, public scrutiny, and love. <i> reputation</i>'s associated tour, the <i> Reputation Stadium Tour </i>, became the highest-grossing tour in U.S. history, as well as the decade's highest-grossing tour by a female artist. She would later switch up her aesthetic for a more pink, romantic one with 2019's <i> Lover </i>, being her first album with Republic Records. "Cruel Summer" became one of Swift's biggest hits after a resurgence in popularity. Swift also released "Only the Young", a protest political song, alongside her documentary <i> Miss Americana </i>. The associated tour, <i> Lover Fest </i>, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. In 2023, Swift released "All of the Girls You've Loved Before", and added it onto <i> Lover </i> as part of the album's <i> The More... Chapter </i>.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      Swift once again crossed genres, from pop to indie/alternative music, with 2020's surprise-drop <i> folklore </i>. Critics and fans alike gave it critical acclaim, praising Swift's songwriting. <i> folklore </i> gave Swift her third AOTY Grammy. In December of the same year, Swift yet again surprise-dropped <i> folklore</i>'s sister album <i> evermore </i>. While less successful than <i> folklore </i>, <i> evermore </i> once again proved that Swift was a master at songwriting. The two eras are normally referred to as "folkmore", and feature woodsy, cottagecore aesthetics, with <i> folklore </i> being in black-and-white.

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      2021 saw the start of the <i> Taylor's Version </i> albums, rerecordings of her first six studio albums, after they were sold to Scooter Braun. Each rerecording consisted of rerecords of all the songs on the original album, as well as additional tracks that were written/intended for the album, but didn't make the cut or were released as separate songs. Said tracks are considered "vault tracks", and are titled as <i> From the Vault </i>. Her first rerecording was of 2008's <i> Fearless </i>, now titled <i> Fearless (Taylor's Version) </i>, with 7 additional bonus tracks, including "Today was a Fairytale" (although said song wasn't labeled as a vault track, it was not included on the original album), released as a separate single for the movie <i> Valentine's Day </i>. Later on, in 2023, Swift added former <i> Speak Now </i> track, "If This Was a Movie", to <i> Fearless (Taylor's Version) </i>, as part of the album's <i> The More... Chapter </i>. In the same year, Taylor rereleased the rerecording of 2012's <i> Red </i>, <i> Red (Taylor's Version) </i>. The album featured 10 additional tracks, including charity single "Ronan", Little Big Town's "Better Man", Sugarland's "Babe" (where she featured), and an extended, 10-minute version of "All Too Well", the latter of which being deemed as one of Taylor's best songs by critics. In 2023, Swift released rerecordings of "Safe and Sound" with The Civil Wars and "Eyes Open", both recorded originally for <i> The Hunger Games </i>, and added them onto <i> Red (Taylor's Version) </i> as a part of the album's <i> The More... Chapter </i>.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      In 2022, Swift released <i> Midnights</i>, a return to pop. The album featured much mellow, dreamy pop, inspired by her "sleepless nights". The album received praise from critics, and eventually lead to her being the first and only artist to receive the Grammy for Album of the Year four times. After Midnights, Swift embarked on <i> The Eras Tour </i>, which celebrated her ten studio albums (later eleven after Swift released <i> The Tortured Poets Department </i>), and became the highest-grossing tour in history, as well as the first to earn $2 billion in revenue, among other accolades.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      In 2023, Swift released two more projects of the <i> Taylor's Version </i> saga: <i> Speak Now (Taylor's Version) </i> and <i> 1989 (Taylor's Version) </i>. Both were announced on <i> The Eras Tour </i>. The former project contains 6 additional tracks, whilst the latter contains 7, including "Sweeter than Fiction" (previously released for the movie <i> One Chance </i>, currently a vinyl exclusive) and a rerecording of her remix of "Bad Blood" with Kendrick Lamar.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">
      During her 2024 break from the Eras Tour, Swift released <i> The Tortured Poets Department </i>. The album managed to break the record for highest single-day and single-week streams upon its release on Spotify. It also managed to be the most pre-saved album on Spotify. 14 of its tracks occupied the entire top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100. It would later on become 2024's best-selling album. A year later, Swift released <i> The Life of a Showgirl </i>, inspired by her record-breaking <i> The Eras Tour </i>. It topped <i> The Tortured Poets Department </i> as her most pre-saved album on Spotify. It also broke Adele's decade-long achievement for largest opening week in Billboard history, with over 3.4 million sales.

          <p class="name" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; font-size: 14px; color: #00a3ad;"> <b> <i> Taylor Swift </i></b> is the name of the eponymous debut album of Taylor Swift. It was released on October 24, 2006. The album was predominantly country, with elements of pop and pop-rock, produced by Nathan Chapman and Robert Eris Orrall. To promote the album, Swift embarked on a radio tour. She also utilized MySpace to promote the album, which helped her reach a teenage demographic, in a time where country music wasn't generally targeted and marketed towards teenagers. The standard album contained 11 songs. A deluxe edition contained 3 additional original tracks, as well as a pop remix of "Teardrops on My Guitar". It spawned 5 singles. The era is normally characterized by a pastel green color and butterflies. Critics praised the songwriting of the album. A karaoke version, with all songs containing instrumentals and background vocals only, was released. </p>
